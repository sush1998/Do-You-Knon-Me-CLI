Built a simple CLI quiz app about me using following  APIs :

# [readline-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk "chalk")
Chalk module in Node. js is the third-party module that is used for styling the format of text and allows us to create our own themes in the node. js project.Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want. 
Advantages of Chalk Module: It helps to customize the color of the output of the command-line output.
